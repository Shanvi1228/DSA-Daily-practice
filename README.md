# DSA-Daily-practice
Documenting my journey to build a strong foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms and complexity analysis.

# Goal and Strategy

### Goal
The primary goal is to build accuracy, and deep conceptual understanding of fundamental algorithms, aiming for expertise in time and space complexity analysis.

### Strategy
1.  Solve at least ONE DSA problem every day. (Following the StriversA2Z DSA course)
2.  All solutions are written in *Python*.
3.  Every commit includes the solution, and a note on its **time and space complexity**.
